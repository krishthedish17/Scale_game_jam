# Scale_game_jam
This is a fun little platformer that goes through all the definitions of Scale
This was our first game. We are in high school so we had to balance the development with school but for our first experience posting a game, I think we did pretty good

# Definitions used:

Level 1: increase/decrease in size

Level 2: climbing

Level 3: fish scale
Level 4: a measuring instrument for weighing; shows amount of mass

Level 5: a series of notes differing in pitch according to a specific scheme (usually within an octave).

Level 6: Secret (Go play the game and find out)

OST: Scales up the major octaves slowly (Level 1 starts at C major, win screen ost is in B major)
