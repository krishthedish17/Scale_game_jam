# Scale_game_jam
This enjoyable platformer explores various definitions of "Scale". As our first game, we managed to balance development with our high school commitments. We think we did pretty well for our debut!

# Definitions used:

Levels:

Increase/Decrease in size

Climbing

Fish scale

Weighing instrument showing mass

Musical notes arranged by pitch (usually within an octave)

Secret (Play the game to uncover it)

OST: Progresses through major octaves gradually. Level 1 starts at C major, and the win screen OST is in B major.
